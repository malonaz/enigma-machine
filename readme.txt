1) if rotor x is to the right of rotor y. x has a notch on letter 22.
   if x rotates and is now on position 22. does y rotate
   simulteanously? or does y rotate when x rotates
   from position 22?


2) implement static method in each method, to check respective inputs...


3) if no rotors, do we still have a start config?
   in the specs...
       if no rotrs no config file


4) check plugboard::check_arg.
   what if the last char of input is non_numeric?? will input.eof still work
